# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside **HTML** and **CSS**.

---

## 1. Key Features

- **Client-Side Scripting**: Runs in the browser to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- **Interpreted Language**: No compilation needed; the browser executes code directly.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance on web browsers.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different browsers and operating systems.
- **Event-Driven**: Responds to user actions like clicks, form submissions, or keyboard input.

## 2. How JavaScript Works

1. JavaScript code can be added directly into HTML using `<script>` tags.
2. Browsers interpret and execute the code line by line.
3. JavaScript can manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and communicate with servers.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="greeting">Hello!</h1>

<script>
    document.getElementById('greeting').textContent = "Hello, JavaScript!";
</script>

</body>
</html>
````

## 3. Where JavaScript Can Be Used

* **Web Development**: Frontend interactivity, animations, form validation.
* **Server-Side Development**: Using Node.js to create backend applications.
* **Mobile Apps**: Hybrid apps using frameworks like React Native.
* **Game Development**: Browser-based games using libraries like Phaser.js.
* **Desktop Applications**: Using frameworks like Electron.js.

## 4. JavaScript Basics

* **Variables**: Store data values (`var`, `let`, `const`).
* **Data Types**: Number, String, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
* **Operators**: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise.
* **Functions**: Blocks of reusable code.
* **Events**: Respond to user actions like clicks, input, or key presses.
* **DOM Manipulation**: Change HTML/CSS dynamically.

JavaScript is the backbone of modern web applications and a must-learn language for web developers.
